# Nudges
## What is Nudges?
Nudges is a refactor of Erik Gomez's [Nudge Code](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge) to Swift. 

## Getting Started
You will need to create the folder `/Library/nudges/Resources` in order to place the `nudge.json` and the `logo.png` files.

More details on the code and how to use it will be coming soon...
